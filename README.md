This repository demonstrates a common React Native error: a prop type mismatch. The `BuggyFlatList.js` file shows the incorrect implementation where a string is passed to the `renderItem` prop of FlatList, causing the app to crash or misbehave.  The corrected version in `FixedFlatList.js` shows how to provide the correct prop type (a function) to resolve the issue.  This example highlights the importance of verifying prop types when building React Native applications.
